# AccessEd


The economics of poverty and or wealth of a nation is directly dependent on those who live in it and the capital they contribute to their economy. What the studies and data show is that education is the driving force of these nations most importantly access to it. Through the world bank I was able to see what the data on education shows for developing nations, they weren't good.

The common theme amongst these nations were the lack of access to education for young girls.
Not every country has a law against educating young girls but in many places it is the cultural norm to stop educating girls after primary school. 

This application is dedicated to tracking country by country what the statistics show on girls education and is a call to action for those who want to do something about changing this in our lifetime. 

At the bottom of the app you will find organizations and charities dedicated to help fight the power!
